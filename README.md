# TransitInk OS

TransitInk OS is an ESP32-S3 firmware for a 400×300 e-paper transit dashboard,
developed for the Zectrix Note 4 hardware profile. It displays four independently
configured widgets and includes an on-device Traditional Chinese and English
settings portal.

the [PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0](LICENSE). Commercial use requires a
separate written licence from the applicable copyright holder. Redistributable
fonts, generated glyphs, vendored components, and transport data retain the

[Third-party data](THIRD_PARTY_DATA.md). Binary-release recipients can also use
[Corresponding source and rebuild information](CORRESPONDING_SOURCE.md) to
reproduce the firmware with the pinned Arduino core and libraries.

## Quick start

The helper scripts are intended for macOS or Linux. Python 3 and a C/C++
toolchain are required.

```bash
scripts/install_tools.sh
scripts/audit_python_tools.sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_hk_glyph_font.py --check
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_transit_route_catalog.py --check
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -q
PLATFORMIO_CORE_DIR="$PWD/.platformio" .venv/bin/platformio run -e zectrix_note4
PLATFORMIO_CORE_DIR="$PWD/.platformio" .venv/bin/platformio check -e zectrix_note4 --fail-on-defect high
```

Before replacing the firmware, set the serial port and create a full 16 MiB
backup:

```bash
export ESP32_PORT=/dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
scripts/backup_flash.sh "$ESP32_PORT"
scripts/flash_firmware.sh "$ESP32_PORT"
```

If the new firmware does not work, restore the original image:

```bash
scripts/restore_flash.sh backups/<backup>.bin "$ESP32_PORT"
```

Flashing or restoring firmware can make a device temporarily unusable. Confirm
the board, flash size, and serial port before running either operation.

Existing TransitInk OS installations can update without erasing settings from
the on-device settings portal. Under "設定" / "Settings", choose "檢查韌體更新"
/ "Check for firmware update", then "更新並保留設定" / "Update and keep
settings". The device downloads the board-specific application image over
verified HTTPS, checks its declared size and SHA-256 digest, and writes only the
inactive OTA application slot. NVS Wi-Fi and widget settings and LittleFS route
overrides are not rewritten. Keep the device powered and connected until it
restarts.

## First boot

When no valid settings exist, the device starts a WPA2-protected
`TransitInk-xxxx` Wi-Fi access point. Its randomly generated password is shown
on the device. Connect to it, open `http://192.168.4.1/`, enter the Wi-Fi
settings, and configure up to twelve widget slots across three pages. Each page
contains four ordered positions, and a position may be disabled. The settings
access point remains available until setup is saved or the device is restarted.

After the device has joined its configured Wi-Fi, pressing the Volume button
opens the settings portal on the device's current LAN IP instead of creating the
setup access point. The display shows the local address and a QR code containing
a random session path. The portal remains available until settings are saved,
the device is restarted, or Volume is pressed again. If normal Wi-Fi is
unavailable, the device falls back to the protected `TransitInk-xxxx` access
point.

On the dashboard, Volume Down cycles through pages that contain at least one
configured widget. Empty pages are skipped. Only the visible page refreshes in
the background, so adding another page does not continuously fetch every
configured widget.

TransitInk OS refreshes MTR, London rail, and London bus arrivals every 30
seconds, Hong Kong bus and Green Minibus arrivals every 60 seconds, and journey
time every 120 seconds. Green Minibus setup uses the official region, route,
direction/variation, and stop identifiers. London bus setup accepts a TfL route
number and resolves its direction and stop from the firmware's bundled
catalogue. London rail lines and stations are bundled as well; live arrivals
are filtered by the selected line, station, and direction. The firmware
migrates supported legacy route settings into the first page of the three-page
configuration.

Power settings include an optional daily awake window, defaulting to 08:00–09:00
when first enabled. The device schedules one low-power timer wake at the start,
updates normally during the window, and returns to sleep at the end. Outside the
window, the Wake Up button retains its normal configurable awake duration. To
avoid extra battery use, periodic sleeping maintenance wakes are disabled while
the daily window is enabled. The schedule requires the device clock to have
been synchronized over Wi-Fi at least once since power-on.

The settings portal reads its Hong Kong and London bus and rail route and stop
directories from a versioned catalogue embedded in the firmware. Setup remains
available offline after a factory reset. Live ETA and explicit refreshes for a
new route still require Internet access; refreshed route overrides are saved in
LittleFS. Maintainers refresh the complete bundled catalogue explicitly with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_transit_route_catalog.py --refresh
```

A TfL-only maintainer refresh is also available with `--refresh-tfl`.

Normal builds never contact a transport provider. A public release needs no
external catalog host: if a user cannot find a new route or stop, the
"設定" page offers "找不到站牌？更新所有路線". The device refreshes the
complete KMB/Long Win, Citybus, and Green Minibus route indexes, then refreshes
the routes currently used by the configured widget drafts. Other routes fetch their
stop detail once when first selected after an index update. Updated indexes and
route overrides are written atomically to LittleFS and reused on later visits. See
[Third-party data](THIRD_PARTY_DATA.md) for source attribution and
[Project structure](docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) for the storage boundary.

## Hardware profiles

`zectrix_note4` is the default PlatformIO environment. Its selected profile is
`include/hardware/boards/ZectrixNote4.h`, using an SSD1683-style 400×300 panel.
Product, widget, network, and portal code do not contain this board's GPIO
mapping.

See [Adding hardware](docs/ADDING_HARDWARE.md) for the supported extension path.
Do not assume the Zectrix pinout or flash layout is safe for another board.

## Yue Wan weekday commute dashboard

Version 1.2.0 configures the Zectrix Note 4 as a focused weekday decision
display for reaching Yue Wan Estate by 07:25. It compares only a four-minute
walk followed by 106→8P and a thirteen-minute walk followed by regular 118.
Boarding ETAs come from the official Citybus/KMB feeds and are combined with
explicit conservative ride, boarding and transfer assumptions; ETA rows are not
treated as observed end-to-end journey times.

The default Hong Kong schedule refreshes immediately at 06:00, polls every 120
seconds until 06:40, every 30 seconds until 07:10, and every 120 seconds in
late/recovery mode until a final 07:30 update. There is no automatic weekend
session. Home starts a ten-minute manual session outside the window. Standby
uses light sleep rather than deep sleep, keeps the last e-paper image, and stops
periodic network traffic. Weather is cached for at least fifteen minutes, while
unchanged e-paper regions are not refreshed.

See [Morning handoff](docs/MORNING-HANDOFF.md),
[first-flash checklist](docs/FIRST-FLASH-CHECKLIST.md), and
[recovery plan](docs/RECOVERY-PLAN.md) before physical testing.

## Web installer and releases

The browser installer is maintained in [`installer/`](installer/) so its source,
firmware version, merged first-install image, OTA application image and
manifests are released together. Build a local installer package after the
firmware build with:

```bash
PLATFORMIO_CORE_DIR="$PWD/.platformio" \
  .venv/bin/python scripts/package_installer.py
```

Generated Pages content is written to `dist/installer/` and is not committed.
Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag whose version matches `FIRMWARE_VERSION` publishes the
merged image, settings-preserving OTA image, checksums, legal notices and a
downloadable firmware bundle as GitHub Release assets, then deploys the same
package through GitHub Pages. The
canonical installer is
[https://zerie55699.github.io/transitink-os/](https://zerie55699.github.io/transitink-os/).
